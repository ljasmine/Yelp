# Project 2 - *Yelp*

**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **25** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Search results page
- [X] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
- [X] Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
- [X] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
- [X] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
- [X] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
- [X] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
- [X] Distance filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
- [X] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is [here](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
- [X] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement a custom switch instead of the default UISwitch.
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Yelp launch screen and Yelp app icon
- [X] User sees loading state while waiting for yelp API

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How can I make "See All" animate the expansion of rows below it only?
2. How can I modify autolayout constraints at runtime?


## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Challenges I faced while building the app include: wrestling with autolayout, modifying autolayout constraints at runtime, making the filters page (so many variables and states to keep track of), and making sections expand.
